# Image-Similarity-Program-JAVA-
This is a function to compare the difference between two images. Very basic stuff but very useful for basic image attempt.

As I said, the algorithm used for this function is very basic. It compares the RGB between each pixel from each image. Input should be two bufferedimage, output will be a double variable stands for the similiarity between two images.
